About This Repository
The files and folders in this repository are provided as a working example of what your Adafruit Memento board should look like once you've installed CircuitPython and copied over the necessary code and libraries.

I recommend using the pre-zipped lib/ folder included here — it contains all the required CircuitPython libraries for this project, so you don’t have to install them individually.

The main code.py script in this repository is a modified version of example code, and matches the version used in my Adafruit Playground tutorial titled:

Adafruit Memento Time-lapse w/ Online Upload & Email Notification

A Quick Note
This was created as part of a work project, and I won’t be actively maintaining it moving forward.

Pull requests and GitHub Issues are disabled for that reason.

If you run into trouble getting this to work, please refer to the links and guides mentioned in my Playground write-up. I’ve tried to make everything beginner-friendly and well-documented.

Thank you for checking this out — I truly hope it inspires someone to build something fun, creative, and connected.
